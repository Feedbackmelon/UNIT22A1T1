	<div id="FPS" class="genre">
		<h1>FPS</h1>
		<p>
			FPS stands for first person shooter, it applies to any game which involves
			shooting something in first person. This genre is very vague as it involves any
			game that meets this criteria. You could have something with bare bones mechanics
			such as Quake or Doom, and then have a game with throughly in depth mechanics such as 
			Rainbow Six Siege, and they will still be in the same genre.
		</p>
		<h2>Examples:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Quake</li>
			<li>Call of Duty</li>
			<li>Rainbow 6 Siege</li>
			<li>Counter Strike, Global Offensive</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="Asymmetrical" class="genre">
		<h1>Asymmetrical</h1>
		<p>
			Asymmetrical is a genre of game that involves 2 sides against each other however
			both with vastly different roles and capabilities. The most popular sub genre of this
			genre is the 1vX Asymmetrical. This sub genre involves one power role and X amount of
			roles of a lesser power that have to work together to defeat their opponent. A great
			example of this type of genre is Dead By Daylight. Dead By Daylight is a 1v4 asymmetrical
			in which 4 'survivors' face 1 'killer'. The 4 survivors need to repair 5 generators around
			the map and the killer needs to find a survivor, damage them 2 times and the hang them on
			a hook a maximum of 3 times in order to kill a survivor. Survivors have tools to defend themselves
			such as pallets they can pull down to stun the killer that once pulled down allow them to slide over them
			quickly where as the killer needs to break it, and vaults in which the survivor can 'vault' over whereas the 
			killer must slowly climb over.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Traditional Asymmetrical games involve less of a power gap, for example the popular zombie game
			left4dead has a versus mode that allows players to play as the survivors or the zombies. The survivors
			role is to get to the end of the level whereas the zombies role is to delay or kill them. Roles are switched at the
			end of each round and teams are scored depending on how far they got as survivors, how quickly and on how many survived.	
			Unlike in Dead By Daylight, in left4dead both teams have 4 players.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Examples:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Dead By Daylight</li>
			<li>Left 4 Dead</li>
			<li>Identity V</li>
			<li>Last Year: The Nightmare</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="Horror" class="genre">
		<h1>Horror</h1>
		<p>
			Horror is a game genre that includes any game with the intent to scare or make the player uneasy.
			Horror has a variety of sub genres such as survival horror and psychological horror, the listed are what
			i will be covering.
		</p>
		<h3>Survival Horror</h3>
		<p>
			Survival horror is a sub genre of horror that puts the player in a situation with limited resources and "over powered" enemies.
			These enemies are normally very difficult or impossible to kill and often take on a terrifying appearance. The resources that
			are limited are normally bullets, weaponry, batteries for a flash light, or other equipment. An example of  a survival horror game
			is outlast, a game that involves the protagonist finding themselves trapped in a spooky insane asylum, running away from its inhabitants
			and searching for camera batteries in order to keep their ability of being able to see in the dark.
		</p>
		<h3>Psychological horror</h3>
		<p>
			Psychological horror is a sub genre of the horror genre that includes disturbing or making the player feel uneasy via psychedelic visuals,
			mind games, and uneasy atmosphere. This sub genre typically has little game play, focusing mostly on exploration or puzzles. Yume Niki for example
			relies completely on atmosphere and exploration to create its suspense, the player needs to explore the content of the game to find a number of "effects"
			which they need to drop in the "nexus" to get the games ending. PT for example has pretty much no exploration however relies on puzzle solving and atmosphere
			to create its horror.
		</p>
		<h2>Examples:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>PT</li>
			<li>Silent Hill</li>
			<li>Yume Nikki</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="Sports" class="genre">
		<h1>Sports</h1>
		<p>
			Sports games are titles meant to mimic real life sports and aim to do so flawlessly. For example football exists so there are sports games of it.
			Due to this sports games are the same each time primarily due to the sport itself not changing, this is rarely seen with other titles due to them
			not being based on something in reality; even simulator games have much more different ways they go about things.
		</p>
		<h2>Examples:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fifa</li>
			<li>Madden</li>
			<li>NBA</li>
			<li>Tony Hawks Pro Skater</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="MOBA" class="genre">
		<h1>MOBA</h1>
		<p>
			MOBA stands for 'Multi-player Online Battle Arena' also know as 'real time strategy'.
			Games in this genre typically involve a top down perspective in which the player controls various 'champions'
			and are able to summon lesser NPCS to fight with them alongside other players who have picked other champions.
		</p>
		<h2>Examples:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>League of Legends</li>
			<li>DOTA 2</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			MOBA's are known to be very strategy oriented and are common e sports, for example, league of legends.
			Winning in MOBA's is often very Dependant on decision making and team composition.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="MMO" class="genre">
		<h1>MMO</h1>
		<p>
			MMO stands for 'Massively Multilayer Online', the genre encompasses any game that has a large amount
			of players on a single server at one time, normally at least 100. MMO's can typically link in with a variety
			of other genres such as FPS, RPG, or Survival.
		</p>
		<h3>MMORPG:</h3>
		<p>
			MMORPG's are the most common type of MMO. MMORPG's are RPG's that are played with a large amount of other
			players on the same server. MMORPGS are typically played in third person with an array of spells or items within
			a hot-bar. These spells and items are not as detailed as spells or items in single player RPG's
			as to reduce load on the server due to the large amount players. MMORPGS are known to have player made
			guilds which function like 'groups' in other games.
		</p>
		<h2>Examples:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Runescape</li>
			<li>Planetside</li>
			<li>PUBG</li>
			<li>ESO</li>
			<li>Rust</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="Turn-Based RPG" class="genre">
		<h1>Turn-Based RPG</h1>
		<p>
			Turn based RPGs are RPGs Where the player and the mosters they encounter fight eachother on a turn based basis.
			Turn based RPGs are typical more stratagy oriented than typical RPGs. This stratagy comes from learning an enemies attack pattern,
			their weaknesses and keeping into acount your resources. Typicaly in turn based RPGs there is a "magic" system where the player
			and their party members have a certain amount of points they can spend on spells and can only replenish at certain points, This
			adds to gameplay as the player needs to decide wether or not to save their points for the final boss of the area or to spend them
			to make the battles end quicker.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to this style turn based RPG's may get boaring to some players, to combat this some turn based RPG developers have
			attempted to remedy this by implementing unique mechanics to keep the player on their toes. For example in Mother 2 (earthbound)
			and Mother 3 a rolling HP counter was implemented meaning if a party member took "mortal damage" they could be healed before the
			timer reached 0 and would not die, this makes end game boss fight especialy tense as it forces the player to rush their choices
			in order to save the character in time.
		</p>
		<h2>Examples:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The Mother Series</li>
			<li>ChronoTrigger</li>
			<li>Off</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="Bullet Hell" class="genre">
		<h1>Bullet Hell</h1>
		<p>
			Bullet hell is a genre of games that typical involves a large amount of projectiles with a specific pattern
			to avoid. Bullet hell games typical have shooter mechanics and can also be apart of a variety of other genres
			such as rouglikes or space shooters.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bullet Hell games are notable for being very difficult due to the amount of attention the player needs, attacks
			are often very hard to dodge and require a lot of movement to avoid. For example typical attacks may involves
			circles of projectiles going outwards from the enemy, overlapping streams of projectiles that wave back and forth,
			or simply a lot of bullets.
		</p>
		<h2>Examples:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Enter The Gungeon</li>
			<li>The Binding Of Isaac</li>
			<li>Jamestown</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="Platformer" class="genre">
		<h1>Platformer</h1>
		<p>
			Platformers are one of the most common types of games, they are rather simple however can have a lot of different
			features. The simplest type of platformer is the classic "Mario" platformer in which the player traverses a scrolling
			level with enemies to avoid and power ups to collect. Platformers can get as complicated as a game like contra with
			a large amount of things to avoid in the view and more in-depth movement mechanics.
		</p>
		<p>
			In conclusion however platformers are simply a definition for any game that involves jumping from platform to platform.	
		</p>
		<h2>Examples:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The Mario Franchise</li>
			<li>Contra</li>
		</ul>
</div>
<div id="Survival" class="genre">
	<h1>Survival</h1>
	<p>
		Survival games are games that place the player somewhere with limited resources, forceing them to explore and loot various objects and structures to survive.
		Different to survival horror, in survival games tend to be significantly more open and less liniar and a lot of the time dont even have an end objective at all.
		The most influential game in the genre, "minecraft" solved this issue by implementing a large amount of creative tools for the player to use however other games
		such as dont starve add micro objectives in the form of bosses and event to keep the player ocupied; for example, its significantly harder to survive in winter than
		it is autumn.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		Some survival games such as rust and 7 days to die bring multi player into the mix. For example in Rust the main threat in the game is not the environment
		but other players, as a result the game has an extensive PVP system as well as a building and raiding system. Because of this many players spend a lot of
		time playing out of fear of being "off-line raided".
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Minecraft</li>
		<li>Dont Starve</li>
		<li>Rust</li>
		<li>7 days to die</li>

		</div>
	</div>
	<div id="Console" class="genre">
		<h1>Console</h1>
		<p>
			Console is generally the first thing people think of when they think of game development.
			This makes sense as console is one of the most popular platforms within gameing and is the most
			normalized, when people see adverts for games on TV typically it is advertised that they are out or
			are exclusive for console. Consoles themselves are advertised on TV often, its not known to have adverts
			for desktop components on the TV however it is known that consoles are advertised on TV.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			unfortunately developing games on consoles has a fee for both releasing and updating games, as a result
			most developers cannot afford to release on console leaving the platform for the larger developers such as EA,
			Ubisoft and Activision.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Despite this many developers aim to get their titles released on console, this is because although it is expensive
			their title gets a lot of exposure on there and as a result can lead to larger profits.
		</p>
		<h2>Examples:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Sony PlayStation Consoles</li>
			<li>Microsoft's XBox Consoles</li>
			<li>Nintendo's Switch</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="PC" class="genre">
		<h1>PC</h1>
		<p>
			Whereas the Console platform sells itself on convenience the PC platform sells itself on power, customization and low cost to
			the developer and or publisher. Whereas Console have a fee for releasing on them the PC does not and as a result
			has a larger array of games, primarily from independent developers who dont have as much money as a more well
			known developer.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition the components expected for someone to have inside a gaming PC are significantly stronger than the counterpart
			of a regular console. Your typical gaming PC would have a midrange graphics card (1050 or 1060 for example) as well as
			more than a minimal amount of RAM. Because of this developers can get away with creating more demanding graphics, the downside to this however is a
			lot of the time the graphics are not the reason for a game to have a particular requirement, but instead the reason is that it is poorly optimised
			due to the developer feeling too safe about the theoretical capability of the users computer.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are a variety of different game stores that operate on PC and each one takes a different share of a
			developers revenue.
		</p>
		<h2>Game Store Examples:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Steam</li>
			<li>Microsoft Store</li>
			<li>Epic Games Store</li>
			<li>Origin</li>
			<li>UPlay</li>
			<li>Discord Store</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="mobile" class="genre">
		<h1>Mobile</h1>
		<p>
			The mobile platform similar to consoles has its selling point as convenience. Unlike consoles
			and the PC platform however the mobile platforms main selling point is mobility. Due to this the
			mobile platform is the fastest growing of the platforms currently due to the incredible
			accessibility of it.
		</p>
		<p>
			The downside to the mobile platform is that mobile devices have very limited processing power
			and other resources. Because of this games developed for mobile need to be well optimized unless
			they are inherently light weight.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition publishing on a mobile platform such as Google play is
			very cheap. Due to this the mobile platform is a great place for game developers
			to get started. The downside to this unfortunately is due to the low bar for entry, many
			low quality products get put on mobile stores and due to the amount of people who publish on
			them, a developers work can very easily be burried by the work of others.
		</p>

			<li>Apples App Store</li>

		<h1>Microphone</h1>
		<p>
			A Microphone is a peripheral that acts as an input device

			detection this is often used to add more suspense to horror games
			via allowing NPCs to recognise the sound made by the player and
			act upon it, or implement events that occur upon the player
			makeing sound via the microphone. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Microphones however are normaly just used to create
			a way for players to easily communicicate within multiplayer
			games. its a lot easier to speek a response or callout
			rather than to type one.

		<h1>Xbox Kinect</h1>
		<p>
			The Xbox Kinect is a peripheral that acts as a camera to reveive input
			from the player via movement. It is exceptionaly usefull for danceing
			games and is very usefull for any games that intend to include motion controls.
			Unfortunately it failed due to not enougth games being created for it

	<div id="Art" class="genre">
		<h1>Art</h1>
		<p>
			Within the game development industry there are many important sectors. One of these
			sectors is the Art sector. this sector covers all of the Art within a video game.
			<h2>Concept Art:</h2>
			<p>
				Creating Concept Art is an important early step in game development as it creates
				a reference for other asset creators to work with. Concept art involves the creation of
				art that is meant to resemble the desired look of a game or game area. You can have
				concept art for levels, characters, weapons or more.
			</p>
			<h2>Texturing:</h2>
			<p>
				Texturing is an area withing art creation in game development, it involves
				creating textures for the environment, characters, UI or more. Texturing requires
				the developer to know how to draw and in general create assets. However if a game has
				a more 'realistic' art style the skill of image editing may also be used for this task.
			</p>
			<h2>Meshing:</h2>
			<p>
				Meshing is the task of creating 3d assets to be imported into a game.
				Meshes do not have textures and as a result needs to be textured or textured by
				someone in charge of said task.
			</p>
			<h2>Rigging:</h2>
			<p>
				Rigging is the task of creating a "rig" for model that an animator can work with.
				Rigs are essentially skeletons that are created for models that can be moved to effect said model.
				This is often done by either the person in charge of meshing or the animator however, depending on how
				complex the rig is it may be done by someone with a specialization.
			</p>
			<h2>Animation:</h2>
			<p>
				Animation is the task of animating a 3d model or 2d sprite. This involves adding movement to it
				such as running and jumping. Animation is typically done via manipulating a "rig".
			</p>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="Sound design" class="genre">
		<h1>Sound design</h1>
		<p>
			Sound design is an area in game development that involves the creation of sound.
			This involves both creating music, sound effects, as well as ambient sound.
		</p>
		<h2>Music Creation:</h2>
		<p>
			Music Creation involves the creation of music for use within a game.
			Music within a game typical is made to go with the games sounds and
			to loop smoothly.
		</p>
		<h2>Sound Effects</h2>
		<p>
			Creating sound effects is an important area of game development. good
			sound effects add realism to the world and make the game feel much better. Bad sound
			effects do the opposite.
		</p>
		<h2>Ambient music/sound</h2>
		<p>
			Ambient music is a type of "music" that plays within an area to create a certain mood.
			Ambient music is typical subtle, it can be used to create tension or to create a mood
			of happiness.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="Programming" class="genre">
		<h1>Programming</h1>
		<p>
			Programming is an area in game development that involves creating logic for the game to
			run. Without programming their would not be a video game at all and as a ressult it is the most
			important part of video game development.
		</p>
		<h2>Client Side Programming</h2>
		<p>
			Client side programming involves the creation of any program that runs client side,
			this means it runs on the users computer instead of externally. Typical client
			side programming consists of most of the games code (if the game is multiplayer)
			or all of the games code if its single player.
		</p>
		<h2>Server Side Programming</h2>
		<p>
			Server Side programming involves the creation of any program that runs on a server.
			This program is typically responsible for getting externaly stored data from the server for
			the client side program to read. Server side programming is only used for multiplayer games
			or for DRM.
